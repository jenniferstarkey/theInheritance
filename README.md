Practice: Custom Colors and Sounds


1.Move all common properties in your vehicles to a new Vehicle class.<br>
2.Create an instance of each vehicle.<br>
3.Define a different value for each vehicle's properties.<br>
4.Create a Drive() method in the Vehicle class.<br>
5.Override the Drive() method in all the other vehicle classes. Include the vehicle's color in the message (i.e. "The blue Ram drives past. RRrrrrrummbbble!").<br>
6.Create a Turn(string direction) mathod, and a Stop() method on Vehicle. Define a basic implementation of each.<br>
7.Override all three of those methods on some of the vehicles. For example, the Stop() method for a plane would be to output the message "The white Cessna rolls to a stop after rolling a mile down the runway."<br>
8.Make your vehicle instances perform all three behaviors.<br>
